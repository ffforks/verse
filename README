				Verse

This is the Verse protocol and sample server implementation.

For more information, see <http://www.blender.org/modules/verse/>.

Running "make" here will build the API library, "libverse.a" (and its
header file, "verse.h"). These two will then be used to build the
reference Verse server binary, called "verse".
